    A base class for geometry-related functionality.

    This class provides a foundation for building geometry-related classes.
    It defines a placeholder method 'area()' that raises an exception,
    indicating that the method needs to be implemented by derived classes.

    Methods:
    - area(): Placeholder method for calculating the area of a geometry.
    Must be implemented by derived classes.

    Usage:
    >>> from my_module import BaseGeometry

    >>> geometry_instance = BaseGeometry()
    >>> geometry_instance.area()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
